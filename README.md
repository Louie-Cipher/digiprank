# DigiPrank

## A simple Digispark script that keeps opening a youtube video in a loop.

## How it works

-   Then, it opens a youtube video using the default browser.
-   After that, it keeps opening new tabs with the same video in a loop.

    `git clone https://github.com/Louie-Cipher/digiprank.git`
-   Open the `digiprank.ino` file with the Arduino IDE.
-   Optional: Change the video link in the `digiprank.ino` file.
